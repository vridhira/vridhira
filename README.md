## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

VRIDHIRA is built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack.

- **Framework:** **Next.js 14+** (using the App Router for server-centric architecture).
- **Language:** **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** with **ShadCN/UI** for a beautiful, accessible, and production-ready component library built on Radix UI primitives.
- **Icons:** **Lucide React** for a consistent and clean icon set.
- **Authentication:** **NextAuth.js (v5)** provides secure, session-based authentication with credentials (email/phone) and Google OAuth providers.
- **Firebase Integration:** **Firebase Auth** is used for backend phone number OTP verification, enabling secure phone-based logins and password resets.
- **State Management:** **React Context API** is used for managing global state for the shopping cart and wishlist.
- **Forms & Validation:** **React Hook Form** for performant form handling, paired with **Zod** for robust schema-based validation.
- **Development Backend:** For development, the application uses a **file-based database** (`users.json`, `products.json`, etc.) to simulate a real-world backend, managed via server-side file system operations (`fs`).
- **AI Integration:** **Genkit** is configured for future AI features, such as product description generation or customer support bots.
